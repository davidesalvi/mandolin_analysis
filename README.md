# Mandolin survey analysis

This repository was created for the project of the Data and Results Visualization PhD course.

## Project description

We conducted a blind listening test on five classical mandolins and collected the responses from more than 100 people with different musical background.
All the instruments were built by the same luthiers in a progressive fashion, starting from a model very close to tradition up to one with significant structural changes.
With this test we want to determine whether the differences in the building reflect different sound characteristics
