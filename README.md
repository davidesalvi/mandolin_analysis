# Mandolin survey analysis

This repository was created for the project of the Data and Results Visualization PhD course.

## Project description

We conducted a blind listening test on five classical mandolins and collected the responses from more than 100 people with different musical background.
All the instruments were built by the same luthiers in a progressive fashion, starting from a model very close to tradition up to one with significant structural changes.
With this test we want to determine whether the differences in the building reflect different sound characteristics

## Surveys descritption

2 analysis have been conducted. <br />

##### ANALYSIS 1
15 professional mandolin players were involved. They were asked to express which are the most meaningful adjectives to describe the sound of a mandolin.

FIGURES TO DO:
- [x] histogram with responses on adjective couples
- [x] opinions on most relevant aspects in a mandolin


##### ANALYSIS 2
108 responses were collected from a heterogeneous population.
5 mandolins are heard in a blind listening test and are evaluated on 5 different acoustical aspects.
Then 3 of these instruments are compared in pairs.
Information on the background of the respondents is available.

FIGURES TO DO:
- [x] information on the audience
- [x] boxplot/violin plot on the features of each violin
- [ ] feature "fingerprint" of the instruments
- [ ] comparison of the mandolins
- [ ] matrix plot (correlation between the features)
- [ ] correlation between answers and musical background of the respondents
- [ ] others (line plots?)
